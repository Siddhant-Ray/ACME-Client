# NetworkSecurity-ACME-Project

Contains my solution for the ACME project for the course Network Security HS 2021 at ETH Zurich.

To run the ACME client, cd to project and execute 
1. ./compile
2. ./run 

To run the test ACME certificate authority (CA), cd to pebble-test and execute 
1. ./pebble-run.sh 

Before running the project, GO must be installed and added to path.
