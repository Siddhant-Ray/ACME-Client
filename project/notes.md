## Project log notes

* urllib.requests was getting hard to work with, switched to Requests. Put install Requests in compile script.
* Read Flask documentation, much easier than server.https from standard library. Put install Flask in compile script.

### TODO 

Fix DNS server, local testing still not working for DNS requests.
Move shutdown server to within main script (Flask should make that possible). This reduces an additional thread needed?
